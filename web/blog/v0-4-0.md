## Mobile support and CSS themes

In this release we focused on making Treehouse more powerful and enjoyable to use from more places. Editing text on mobile is always a tricky prospect, but we've taken our first step to being mobile-friendly with customized navigation and easier touch targets.

White background a bit too bright? We've added several built-in themes (including sepia and dark mode) *and* we've made it super easy to [create your own CSS themes](https://treehouse.sh/docs/user/#css-theming) using our component variables.

Otherwise, lots of quality of life improvements as usual, especially for fields and live search nodes.
